# Discord Pal
Discord Bot for the double degree discord. Meant to be a collaborative project for all DD students within the Computer Science (UW) and Business Administration (WLU) program on either side. Anyone is welcome to commit changes, any and all contributions are welcome as long as they make sense.

Bot may be hardcoded at first, but that will change into being more modular.
